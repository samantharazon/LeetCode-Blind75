# a fleet consists of one or more cars that travel together to the target without overtaking each other.

    pairs = [(position[i], speed[i]) for i in range(len(position))]  # (position, speed) Combines position and speed into a list of pairs. EXAMPLE: [(10, 2), (8, 4), (0, 1), (5, 1), (3, 3)
    lastFleetArrivalTime = 0  # lastFleetArrivalTime represents the time it takes for the last fleet to reach the target. As you process each car from the closest to the target to the farthest, lastFleetArrivalTime is updated to the latest fleet's arrival time.

target = 12
position = [10, 8, 0, 5, 3]
speed = [2, 4, 1, 1, 3]

'''
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target.
The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Example 2:
'''

target = 10
position = [3]
speed = [3]
print(f"\n(#2) target: {target}, position: {position}, speed: {speed}")
result = carFleet(target, position, speed)
print(f"result: {result}")
# Output: 1
'''
Explanation:
There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
'''

target = 100
position = [0, 2, 4]
speed = [4, 2, 1]
print(f"\n(#3) target: {target}, position: {position}, speed: {speed}")
result = carFleet(target, position, speed)
print(f"result: {result}")
# Output: 1
'''
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The car starting at 4 (speed 1) travels to 5.
Then, the fleet at 4 (speed 2) and the car at position 5 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
